                        No, it's technically not possible to use USB IrDA

                        Yes, just make sure that you enable transmitter

                        The value of the resistor in the receiver circuit

                        4k7 Ohm means 4700 Ohm. k is the abbreviation of

                        No, this won't work. But there is a project

                        I have a Hauppauge TV card. Can I use a different
                        remote control with this TV card except the
                        original Hauppauge remote control?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        The Hauppauge remote control uses the <A HREF="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/rc-5/RC-5-extented">RC-5</A>
                        protocol. You should be able to use any TV remote
                        control that uses this protocol. Common brands
                        that use this protocol are Philips and
                        Marantz. A short description how to setup LIRC with an <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=200801192321.02652.tahoward%40nc.rr.com&forum_name=lirc-list">universal remote control</A> was posted on the mailing list.<BR>

                        How do the drivers for the home-brew receivers
                        work? Do they use polling?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        No, the serial port driver is fully interrupt
                        driven. On each edge of the IR signal the
                        interrupt handler is called and the time since the
                        last interrupt is calculated. As the parallel port
                        only generates interrupts on the rising edge of
                        the input signal, the parallel port driver uses
                        polling with the help of the hardware timer until
                        the signal becomes low again. As it is polling
                        only for microseconds this has no noticeable effect
                        on system performance.<BR>

                        I would like to connect an LCD display and an

                        port. Will this work?<BR>
                        <BR>
                        No, unless somebody writes a driver that merges
                        the functionality of the kernel serial port driver
                        and the LIRC lirc_serial driver. This is not
                        trivial. I don't have any plans to do it.<BR>

                        Another application is probably already accessing

                        a time. You can find out which process uses the

                        Most of the time I have to push a button twice for

                        <BR>
                        <P>The remote control probably uses the RC-5,
                        RC-6 or RECS80 protocol, but irrecord wasn't
                        able to recognize this correctly.
                        </P>
                        <P>Try running <em>irrecord
                        remotes/generic/RC-5.conf</em>, <em>irrecord

                        remotes/generic/RECS80.conf</em>.  You will
                        find these template config files inside the
                        LIRC source package.  If this won't work read

                        Every time I press a button on my remote control
                        irw will show at least 5 events (or any other
                        number &gt; 1) independent of how short I try
                        pressing the button.<BR>
                        <P>In most cases this is the correct behavior. Many
                          remote controls send the same code multiple times
                          to make sure that at least one code comes through
                          to the receiver when you press a button for a
                          short time. The default .lircrc setup ignores
                          repeat events. If you want to use the button to do
                          things repeatedly when it is being hold down, like
                          e.g. increasing the volume or something similar,
                          you should use the <em>delay</em> token (will be
                          available in 0.7.0) in your .lircrc file.</P>
                        <P>You can identify such remotes by the fact that
                          irrecord usually will add a <em>min_repeat</em>
                          field for this remote control to the lircd.conf
                          config file.</P>
                        <P>If you want to suppress those repeats
                          already at lircd level, you can also add
                          <em>suppress_repeat x</em> to the
                          lircd.conf config file where <em>x</em> is
                          the number of repeats you want  to
                          suppress. This feature is available in lircd
                          since release 0.8.6.

                        I'm running Mandrake 9.2 and the LIRC applications
                        all report:
                        <PRE>
could not connect to socket
connection refused
                        </PRE>
                        <BR>
                        These applications expect the lircd socket in /tmp
                        (blame Mandrake).
                        The following command will fix the problem.
                        <PRE>
ln -s /dev/lircd /tmp/.lircd
                        </PRE>
                        Please note that you might have to execute this
                        command on every system startup as /tmp usually is
                        cleaned up during startup.<BR>

                        I need a config file for &lt;<em>brand</em>&gt;
                        &lt;<em>device</em>&gt;. Do you have such a config
                        file?<BR>

                        If it's not on the website, then I don't have
                        it. Please don't ask me for config files.<BR>

                          I get way more mails than I can handle. If you

                          probability is very high that you will find the
                          answer in the documentation.
