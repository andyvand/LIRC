    <P>
      First, lirc is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
      just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
      other package. This way, you don't have to look at the
      dependencies, build and installation description found here.
      However, here is also some testing notes which applies if you
      have built your own device.
    </p>
      Mandatory dependencies
    <ul>
      <li>Several scripts need the python3 PyYaml package at
          http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML.</li>
      <li> Overall, python3 is.required for the build </li>
      <li>The build also needs man2html.</li>
      <li>The configuration script needs python3-gi and thus also the Gtk
          libs. It's not required for the build, though. </li>.
    </ul>

    <P>
      If you want to compile and use all tools, you also need an
      installed version of the  X
      Windows header files (needed by <em>irxevent</em> and
      <em>xmode2</em>) The configure script will notify you if
      some necessary files are missing and the according tools won't
      be compiled.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>Irman (=UIR) :</B> To use your Irman with LIRC you need the
      latest <A HREF="http://www.lirc.org/software/snapshots/">
      <em>libirman</em></A> library. At the time this has been written
      the current libirman version was 0.4.3.  To build, the irman
      library must exist as a dynamic .so module. At the time of writing
      this is true for the Fedora package, but not for Debian.
   </P>

    <A NAME="kernel"></A>

    <P>
      As of 0.9.1+, lirc uses the kernel modules from the official
      kernel. Some of these are formerly lirc modules which are
      now part of the kernel. Thus, building lirc does not involve
      building kernel modules (as it used to be).
    </P>
    <p>
      Some of the former lirc modules are part of the official kernel
      and should be available on any reasonably updated system. However,
      some are in the staging area; if they are part of your kernel
      depends on the distro you use (unless of course if you compile
      your own kernel).
    <P>
    <P>
      If you want to use a home-brew receiver, an Anir Multimedia
      Magic, a Packard Bell receiver, the IRdeo or if you want to use
      the SIR IrDA driver, I suggest that you use the lirc_serial
      or lirc_sir module.  Usually the serial port driver grabs all
      ports it auto-detects as soon as it is loaded and the LIRC
      modules won't be able to use any of them.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are two solutions for this problem. Either you load the
      LIRC module before the kernel serial port driver is loaded
      (that's why you have to compile it as a module) or you call
      <em>setserial /dev/ttySx uart none</em> to release the according
      port. setserial usually is already called during boot-up in some
      init script whose location depends on the distribution you
      use.  If you tell setserial to
      configure a port that is already claimed by a LIRC module, the
      kernel serial driver will steal the port from the LIRC module
      and LIRC will stop working. So check your setserial
      configuration to only configure available ports. Debian users
      should adjust their <em>/etc/serial.conf</em>.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>TV cards:</B> To use any remote control receivers connected
      directly to a bttv based TV card you will need a working bttv
      setup in your kernel. For most TV cards we rely on bttv
      autodetection. That way you don't have to give any parameters to
      the module as they are selected internally depending on the
      information the bttv module gives us. This means that you should
      pay attention that your TV card is detected correctly by bttv.
    </P>

    <P>
      Generally speaking everything that can receive or send infrared
      signals can be supported by LIRC. The project began with support
      for home-brew receivers and transmitters for the serial port and
      later support for analogous hardware for the parallel port was
      added. At that time the focus of the project was to provide an
      infrared solution that is both very cheap and easy to
      assemble. The following links point to instructions how to build
      your own receiver/transmitter.

    <P>
      Current versions of LIRC now support many more commercially
      available solutions. Examples are the Irman, built-in IrDA ports
      or TV cards. Drivers for even more hardware are likely to appear
      in the future. If you are a programmer who wants to maintain
      such a driver you are welcome to join the project.

    <P>
      Since 0.9.1+ , lirc loads drivers dynamically. This means that
      that the build system is redesigned to always build all drivers.
      The former setup.sh script is dropped in favor of a standard
      ./configure, make, make install sequence.
    </P>
    <P>
      When running the configure script, please pay attention at its
      output.  After having configured the package just type
     <em>make</em> and lean back.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>Note:</B> You won't find a configure script in the source repo
      version of LIRC. You will have to generate it first by executing

    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Installation</H1>
    <HR WIDTH="70%">

    <P>
      The core program of LIRC is <em>lircd</em>, the LIRC system
      daemon that does all of the decoding of infrared signals. LIRC
      comes with a second daemon program: <em>lircmd</em>. lircmd
      depends on lircd and translates remote control activity to mouse
      movements. Just like all other daemons both lircd and lircmd
      should be started at system boot time and do their work in
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly, lirc was configured during build where the setup.sh script
      was used to select driver, configuration file. Also, there was was
      little support for starting and running the services from boot. From
      0.9.1+ the configuration is instead done after the build. The
      configuration steps for the main lircd program involves:
    <ul>
        <li> Selecting the driver and device. </li>
        <li> Selecting configuration file.</li>
        <li> In some cases e. g., serial devices setting up kernel module
             options in /etc/modprobe.d. </li>
        <li> Configuring and using systemd to run the services. </li>
    </ul>
      This is described in the <a href="configuration-guide.html">
      configuration guide</a>.

   <P>
      When you are using <em>devfs</em> or <em>sysfs</em> with your
      kernel, the /dev/lirc device node will disappear again once you
      reboot your machine. In that case the LIRC kernel module will
      generate the required entry every time it is loaded. But the
      device node won't be visible as /dev/lirc, but might be located
      in a different location like e.g. /dev/lirc0. Please be aware
      of this  when starting programs that access the device node
      like mode2 or lircd. You will have to use the --device command
      line option of these programs to point them to the correct
      location.
   </P>
    <P>
      Now you should adjust the file permissions of
      <em>/var/run/lirc/lircd</em> (this is the Unix domain socket that clients
      use to connect to lircd) so others than <em>root</em> can
      connect to lircd. Either edit lirc_options.conf or use the
      --permissions command line option e. g., </P>
    <PRE>
        lircd --permission 666  <other options>
    </PRE>
    <P>
      should do. You can also create a special group for this purpose.
    </P>
    <P>
      Finally you might want to add <em>/usr/local/lib</em> to
      <em>/etc/ld.so.conf</em> so the <em>lirc_client</em> library is
      found by the run-time linker. Don't forget to call
      <em>ldconfig</em> afterwards for the change to take effect.

    <P>
      If you have build the infrared hardware yourself you are
      probably eager to find out if it really works. If you have not
      build the hardware yourself you can skip the first test. For
      most receivers it even won't work because it makes no
      sense.
    </P>

    <P>
      Type <em>su</em> to get root privileges and start <em>mode2</em>
      (<B>Warning:</B> don't confuse mode2 with mode3: mode3 will set
      your video card to a vesa mode using the vesa bios
      calls...). This should load the kernel module into the kernel
      and display the infrared signals. Hold your remote control to
      your infrared receiver and press some buttons. You should see an
      output like this (the values of your remote will probably be
      different):

      If you don't see anything, try to find out: (a) if you selected
      the correct driver with the correct settings (I/O base address,
      IRQ), (b) if you use a remote which works and (c) if your
      hardware works. The voltage input of the infrared receiver
      should be 5V +/- 0.5V, the output pin of the receiver should be
      about 0.5V less than the input voltage.
    </P>

    <P>
      From time to time there should be long spaces (&gt;30000). If you
      can see very long pulses this usually means that sense auto
      detection of your serial port IR receiver circuit has
      failed. You can override sense auto detection by loading the
      device driver with the following option:</P>

    <P>
      <em>modprobe lirc_serial sense=0</em> if your receiver circuit is active
      high or<BR>

      <em>modprobe lirc_serial sense=1</em> if your receiver circuit is active
      low.
    </P>

    <P>
      Well, the driver seems to work, now let's test if lircd also
      does its job. This only works, if lircd uses a <A
      HREF="configure.html#lircd.conf">config file</A> which fits to
      your remote control. Use <A
      HREF="irrecord.html"><em>irrecord</em></A> in the case the LIRC
      distribution doesn't provide a config file suitable for your
      remote and it still is not available at the LIRC homepage. A
      more detailed discussion of creating new config files is

      The LIRC package contains the <A HREF="irsend.html">irsend</A> tool for
      sending infrared signals to e.g. your TV or CD player. For
      reliable transmission a good config file is even more important
      than for receiving. A discussion of all the infrared protocols
      is way beyond the scope of this manual but when creating a
      config file at least read the <A
        HREF="help.html#new_remote">hints</A> at the end of this
      manual. You can find exact timing specifications for most common
      inside the remotes/generic/ directory of the LIRC package.

    <P>
      If you want a graphical interface for controlling your devices
      using LIRC, you might have a look at xrc. You can download the
      xrc package from the LIRC homepage. xrc is a Qt based
      program. Setting up xrc and Qt is a bit tricky so if you don't
      manage to compile it you can still use irsend. It has the full
