    <P>
      The <em>lirc_dev</em> module is a helper and abstraction layer
      for other modules.  It registers <em>/dev/lirc</em> device in a
      system (including support for devfs) and waits for plugin
      registration.  After that it serves device requests (open, read,
      poll, ioctl, close) and if needed calls callback functions from
      plugin(s) to communicate with the physical device.
    </P>
    <P>
      Plugins can be registered and unregistered many times. The
      current implementation allows two concurrent plugins, but can be
      easily changed by increasing the MAX_IRCTL_DEVICES
      definition. It also allows receiving of scan codes, which have
      more than 8 bits. Current limit for a scan code is 16*8 bits and
      also can be changed by increasing the BUFLEN definition.
    </P>
    <P>
      For an API description see <em>lirc_dev.h</em>. The lirc_gpio
      module can be treated as examples of using this API.<br> This
      code contains many lines with debug messages (activated by
      <em>debug</em> option) and they will sustain until more tests
      will be performed.

    <!-- Writing LIRC Applications +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="applications"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Writing Applications for LIRC</H1>
    <HR WIDTH="70%">

    <P>
      As LIRC is able to both receive and send IR commands there are
      two possible types of applications. Programs that send IR
      commands like <em>xrc</em> and <em>irsend</em> or programs that
      receive commands like <em>irexec</em>, <em>irxevent</em> and
      <em>irpty</em>.  Both types of applications will have to connect
      to the lircd daemon using the socket interface usually located
      in /var/run/lirc/lircd. Communication on the socket uses human
      readable format. The end of a line is indicated by a newline
      character.
    </P>
    <P>
      Whenever lircd receives a IR signal it will broadcast the
      following string to each client:</P>
    <PRE>
  &lt;code&gt; &lt;repeat count&gt; &lt;button name&gt; &lt;remote control name&gt;</PRE>
    <P>
      <em>code</em> is a 64-bit encoding (in hexadecimal
      representation) of the IR signal. It's usage in applications is
      deprecated and should be ignored. The <em>repeat count</em>
      shows how long the user has been holding down a button. The
      counter will start at 0 and increment each time a new IR signal
      has been received. The <em>button name</em> and <em>remote
      control name</em> are defined in the lircd config file. Their
      purpose should be quite self-explanatory. They must not contain
      any whitespace.<BR>

      The only other situation when lircd broadcasts to all clients is
      when it receives the SIGHUP signal and successfully re-reads its
      config file. Then it will send a SIGHUP packet to its clients
      indicating that its configuration might have changed. This
      feature is <NOBR>e.g.</NOBR> used in <em>xrc</em> to rebuild the
      list of supported remote controls each time lircd's
      configuration changes. The format of the packet will be
      explained later.
    </P>
    <P>
      Applications that want to send out IR commands can use the
      following commands:
      </P>
    <PRE>
  SEND_ONCE &lt;remote control name&gt; &lt;button name&gt; [&lt;repeat count&gt;]
  SEND_START &lt;remote control name&gt; &lt;button name&gt;
  SEND_STOP &lt;remote control name&gt; &lt;button name&gt;</PRE>
    <P>
      The SEND_ONCE directive tells lircd to send the IR signal
      associated with the given remote control and button name, and then
      repeat it <var>repeat count</var> times. <var>repeat count</var> is
      a decimal number between 0 and <var>repeat_max</var>. The latter
      can be given as a command line argument to lircd, and defaults
      to 600.  If <var>repeat count</var> is
      not specified or is less than the minimum number of repeats
      for the selected remote control, the minimum value will be
      used. SEND_START tells lircd to start repeating the
      given button until it receives a SEND_STOP command. However, the
      number of repeats is limited to <var>repeat_max</var>. lircd
      won't accept any new send commands while it is repeating.
    </P>
    <P>
      lircd also understands the following commands:
    </P>
    <PRE>
  VERSION
  LIST [&lt;remote control name&gt;]</PRE>
    <P>
      The response to the VERSION command will be a packet containing
      lircd's version.<BR>

      The LIST command without further arguments can be used to get a
      list of all remote controls known to lircd. If a name of a
      supported remote control is given as argument all buttons of the
      given remote control are listed in the reply packet. Have a look
      at <em>xrc</em> for an example how this can be used.
    </P>
    <P>
      There still remains to explain the format of lircd's reply
      packets. Here is a formal description of the packets:
    </P>
    <PRE>
  BEGIN
  &lt;command&gt;
  [SUCCESS|ERROR]
  [DATA
  n
  n lines of data]
  END</PRE>
    <P>
      The protocol guarantees that broadcasted messages won't
      interfere with reply packets. But broadcasts may appear at any
      point between packets. <em>command</em> is the command lircd is
      currently processing. Its an exact copy of the command the
      client application has sent. The only exception are SIGHUP
      packages where <em>command</em> is substituted with SIGHUP. Note
      that SIGHUP packages may appear just after you have sent a
      command to lircd, so you have to make sure you don't confuse
      them with replies. SIGHUP packages come without any further data
      while each reply to a command contains either SUCCESS or ERROR
      indicating the result of processing the command. In case of an
      error the following data is a message explaining the
      problem. This message can be used to create an error message for
      the user.<BR>

      If the command was successful, data is only sent for the
      commands that return some information. Note that a packet
      containing 0 lines of data can be a valid reply.

          If you use the <em>lirc_serial</em> or
          <em>lirc_parallel</em> driver regularly to transmit
          infra-red signals you might notice that your system clock
          will slow down. During transmit the driver turns off
          interrupts and hence some clock interrupts might get lost
          causing system clock inaccuracy. Unfortunately in order to
          ensure a good signal timing interrupts have to be
          disabled. Currently no work-around is known for this problem
          except using a program like <em>netdate</em> to synchronize
          your system clock regularly.
        </P>
      </LI>
      <LI>
        <P>
          The <em>lirc_serial</em> and <em>lirc_parallel</em> drivers
          measure the time between interrupts on the serial resp.
          parallel port to get a pulse and space representation of the
          incoming infra-red signal. If interrupts are disabled by the
          CPU for a rather long time (&gt;100 &micro;s, which happens
          often e.g. during heavy IDE disk activity) some interrupts
          might get lost and the incoming data stream becomes
          disturbed. In this case decoding of the infra-red signal
          will fail. This is the downside of the really simple
          receiver circuits and can't be addressed in software except
          keeping the time where interrupts are disabled to a minimum.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you are using an IDE system you might want to try calling
          <em>hdparm -u1 -d1</em> for all of your drives. This enables
          DMA for the drive and allows the driver to unmask other
          interrupts during handling of a disk interrupt. But be aware
          that this can be dangerous for some (buggy) IDE
          chipsets. Consult the hdparm man page for further
          information.
