.TH MODE2 "1" "Last change: November 2001" "mode2 @version@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
mode2, xmode2 - shows the pulse/space length of infrared signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mode2
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The main purpose of these programs is to check operation of your
home-brew LIRC receiver hardware and to see the IR waveform of the
remote controller without an expensive oscilloscope. Very useful for
debugging. Of course this program won't work with hardware that decodes
the signals itself like e.g. TV cards or the Irman.

mode2 will simply print pulse&space lengths to stdout.
