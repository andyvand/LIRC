[NAME]
irexec - run programs with one button press

[DESCRIPTION]
This program lets you execute arbitrary commands on an IR signal decoded
by lircd, the LIRC daemon. You can give irexec a command line parameter
which has to be a name of a valid config file. If no command line
parameters are given irexec reads the default config file which is
usually ~/.lircrc.

If irexec executes a program it will wait until this program terminates.
So append a '&' to the command string if you don't want that.

The config string consists of the command to be run. Potential
uses are shutting down the computer, starting a dial-up connection etc.

[OPTIONS]
.TP 4
.B  -d, --daemon
Make irexec will fork to background. That way you can easily start irexec
from an init script. In this case you should specify a config file on the
command line as irexec won't be able to find your home directory.
.TP 4
.B -n --name <name>
Use this program name instead of the default 'irexec' as identifier in
the lircd.conf file.

[NOTE]
If you start irexec, it reads your ~/.lircrc and reacts only on
prog= entries that point to irexec. If you have included more than one
program in your .lircrc, then start all these programs, they react
itself only to their according entries in .lircrc.
