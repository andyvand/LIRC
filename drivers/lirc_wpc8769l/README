# Here is an example how to buid a lirc kernel module. This module
# was formerly a part of the lirc distribution, but didn't make it
# when the other modules was moved to the kernel.
#
# Building kernel modules requires that the kernel sources are
# installed. Besides that, there are no particular dependencies.
# There is no need for lirc to be installed for this build.
